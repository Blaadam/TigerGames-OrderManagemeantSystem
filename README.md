# Tiger Games - Order Management System

This application was created as a part of my coursework for Unit 8 - Project Management, and Unit 14 - Software Development for the Cambridge Technicals Level 3 IT.
The "Tiger Games" is a fictional company as a part of the assignment where we had to create documents within the Software Development Life Cycle and define requirements that the client requested - in addition to changing the design in response to the client's feedback.

The Order Management System is built in C# with [ASP.Net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet) on the [Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/overview/?view=netdesktop-8.0) template. The application utilises [Material Design](https://github.com/MaterialDesignInXAML/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit) for the design, and [Entity Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/ef6/) for the database interactions.
